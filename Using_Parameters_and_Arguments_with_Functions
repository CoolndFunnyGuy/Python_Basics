# This code has to do with using parameters and functions within functions.
# In this code, I defined a function called analyze_logins.
# The analyze_logins function is meant to output a string with the arguments set by the parameters.
# The output ends up being "Current day login total for ejones is 9"




# Define a function named `analyze_logins()` that takes in two parameters, `username` and `current_day_logins`

def analyze_logins(username, current_day_logins):

    # Display a message about how many login attempts the user has made that day

    print("Current day login total for", username, "is", current_day_logins)

# Call `analyze_logins()`

analyze_logins("ejones", 9)
