# This code has to do with learning about functions and how to define them.
# In this code, I defined a function called list_to_string.
# The list_to_string function is meant to output a string of usernames from a previously defined username_list variable.
# The output ends up being (elarson, bmoreno, tshah, sgilmore, eraab, gesparza, alevitsk, wjaffrey, )



# Define a function named `list_to_string()`

def list_to_string():

  # Store the list of approved usernames in a variable named `username_list`

  username_list = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza", "alevitsk", "wjaffrey"]

  # Assign `sum_variable` to an empty string

  sum_variable = ""

  # Write a for loop that iterates through the elements of `username_list` and displays each element

  for i in username_list:
    sum_variable = sum_variable + i + ", "

  # Display the value of `sum_variable`

  print(sum_variable)

# Call the `list_to_string()` function

list_to_string()
